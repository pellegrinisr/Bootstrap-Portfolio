                My name is Stephen Pellegrini. I currently work in the IT department at Los Angeles
                Trade Tech College.
                </p>
                <p>
                After I finish the coding bootcamp at the UCLA Extension, I hope to get a job
                as a full stack web developer in Los Angeles.
                </p>
                <p>
                I grew up in Orange County, California, in the city of Yorba Linda. In high school,
                I got my first exposure to computer programming in an AP Computer Science class. We
                learned Java, and I excelled. After high school, I attended UCLA where I studied 
                English Literature and Philosophy. 
                </p>
                <p>
                I chose a traditional, liberal arts education 
                because I believe the ability to think critically is one of the most essential skills
                in today's world.  In addition, through much practice with written and verbal communication,
                I developed strong analytical reasoning skills.  Even though I switched gears, these skills 
                are still applicable, and will surely benefit me in my quest to become a web developer.  
                </p>
                <p>
                Currently I live in Koreatown, in the City of Los Angeles.  My hobbies include hiking,
                traveling, and writing code!
